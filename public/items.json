Its stem (commonly mis-referred to as its root) grows underground and is the part we eat. The stem is either finely grated into a powder or made into a paste, as we typically see it in Japanese restaurants. Wasabi stimulates the nasal passages, providing a hot and cleansing sensation when eaten. Ginger is a plant that originated in southern China. Its root is used in medicine and as a spice. It is often used to treat nausea, which is why you may have been advised to drink ginger ale when you aren’t feeling well. It is also thought to help aid digestion as well.            ",
